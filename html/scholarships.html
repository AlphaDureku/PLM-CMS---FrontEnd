    <h3>FAQs</h3>
    <h4><i>How are scholars selected?</i></h4>
    <p>The scholarship providers evaluate and approve applications based on the following requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Family annual income of Php 300,000.00 or less</li>
            <li>General Weighted Average (GWA) of not less than 2.25</li>
            <li>With no previous scholarship application nor a recipient of any scholarship grant</li>
            <li>Full-time student (from all levels) with regular load</li>
            <li>With good moral character</li>
        </ul>

    <h4><i>Who can be scholarship providers?</i></h4>
    <p>Organizations or individuals interested to provide scholarships to PLM students may contact the Office of Public Affairs (OPA) and enter into a Memorandum of Agreement subject to the Board of Regent's approval.</p>
    <p>Inquiries and letters of intent may be addressed to:</p>
    <p><b>Dina C. Mendez</b>
    <br>OIC, Public Affairs
    <br>email: vppa@plm.edu.ph</p>
    <p>Once the partnership is approved, the OPA contacts the University Committee on Scholarship and Office of Student Development and Services (OSDS) as Committee Secretariat about the scholarship requirements and slots for dissemination to the colleges and Information and Communications Technology (ICTO) so that students who need the financial aid could apply.</p>
    <p>The colleges receive applications from interested students. Then it submits the applications to the OSDS, which creates a shortlist using the scholarship providers' criteria. This list is submitted to the Committee on Scholarship, which makes the final recommendation and submits it to the OPA. The OPA then coordinates the recommended scholars to the scholarship providers for their concurrence.</p>
